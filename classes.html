        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>

    We provide classes that range from gentle and restorative to more vigorous and challenging yoga styles. Our schedule
    is designed to fit your busy lifestyle, with classes available throughout the day and evening, as well as on
    weekends. We also offer private one-to-one sessions tailored to your individual needs.
    For example, our beginner groups offer a gentle introduction to yoga fundamentals. They help you build a strong
    foundation for your practice, while our more advanced classes challenge you to take your practice to the next level.
    Our Yin and Restorative Yoga classes focus on long-held poses and deep relaxation. While our Vinyasa classes are
    more dynamic and physically challenging. Our Hatha Yoga classes provide a balanced approach between Yin and Vinyasa,
    offering a combination of slow-paced and more active poses that can be modified to suit all levels. 
    <br>
    We believe in a holistic approach to health and wellness, so our classes focus on cultivating a mind-body connection. We understand
    that everyone has different needs, so we strive to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable and can
    progress at their own pace. Our experienced instructors will guide you through the postures and offer modifications
    to suit your individual needs.
