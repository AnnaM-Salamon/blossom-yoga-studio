       <h1>Benefits of yoga</h1>
       <p>
        Yoga benefits include improved physical strength, flexibility, and balance.
As well as improved mental clarity, relaxation, and stress relief.
Additionally, yoga relieves chronic pain and increases energy levels.
Finally, yoga can help foster a deeper sense of connection and well-being. This allows practitioners to feel more at peace and in harmony with their bodies and the world around them.

        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>
            Our yoga studio offers a variety of classes that focus on the practice of asanas ( or postures ) as a way to improve physical and mental health.
            * (Asanas are physical yoga postures used to improve flexibility, strength, and balance.)</p>
            
          <p>We provide classes that range from gentle and restorative to more vigorous and challenging yoga styles, all tailored to help you find balance and harmony.
            
           
            Our schedule is designed to fit your busy lifestyle, with classes available throughout the day and evening, as well as on weekends. We also offer private one-to-one sessions tailored to your individual needs. Our studio offers classes for all levels of experience and ability, so everyone can find a practice that works for them. Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned yogi, we will help you find a practice that is right for you.

            Classes
For example, our beginner groups offer a gentle introduction to yoga fundamentals. They help you build a strong foundation for your practice, while our more advanced classes challenge you to take your practice to the next level.
For instance, our Yin and Restorative Yoga classes focus on long-held poses and deep relaxation.
While our Vinyasa classes are more dynamic and physically challenging.
Our Hatha Yoga classes provide a balanced approach between Yin and Vinyasa, offering a combination of slow-paced and more active poses that can be modified to suit all levels.
We believe in a holistic approach to health and wellness, so our classes focus on cultivating a mind-body connection.
We understand that everyone has different needs, so we strive to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable and can progress at their own pace. Our experienced instructors will guide you through the postures and offer modifications to suit your individual needs.
