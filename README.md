### Unfixed Bugs

- The page About us contains two paragraphs of text and pictures. I wanted them to be positioned below the text in the form of a responsive box. I suspect I wasn't able to achieve this as the main content on the page(text) is styled with Flexbox. The idea is to restructure, restyle the whole page again.

- The site responds well in various dimensions  despite Media queries not present 

## Deployment


- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
